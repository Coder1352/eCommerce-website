    <p><u>Types of drones.</u><br>
        Most drones fall into one of two categories: camera drones and toy drones. Racing drones represent a 
        unique version of camera drones and offer competitive but friendly interaction with other drone owners. 
        All drones have features and benefits that vary based on the type.<br><br>
        <u>Camera drones.</u><br>
        Also known as professional or enthusiast drones, these high-end models are typically camera drones. 
        They have integrated cameras capable of high-definition (HD) and 3D images. The latest models have 
        extraordinary capabilities:<br><br>
        
        -Altitudes of a mile or more<br>
        -A flying range of 5 miles or more<br>
        -Top speeds of 70 mph<br>
        -Battery life exceeding half an hour<br><br>
        Many of these are fine for beginners. Some require an experienced hand on the controls, but the 
        internal stabilizing mechanisms help the drone fly smoothly, regardless of the pilot's ability.<br><br>
        
        <u>Racing drones.</u><br>
        This group is a subset of professional drones. These enhanced models offer increased speed and 
        maneuverability. They require HD cameras to provide the operator with a clear view of the racing course.<br><br>
        <u>Toy drones.</u><br>
        Toy drones are simple models designed for basic flight. They are uncomplicated, safe toys that provide 
        entertainment and outdoor fun for all ages. Some of the high-end toy drones are hard to distinguish from 
        the lower-end camera drones. True enthusiasts might admit that their souped-up professional drones are 
        really awesome toys.<br><br>
        <u>Water drones.</u><br>
        Water drones are not for flying but are instead used for exploring underwater. They offer the same wireless
         control and precision image-capturing qualities as the airborne drones in a submersible form. Water and
          fishing enthusiasts enjoy exploring beneath the surface of saltwater and freshwater environments through
         the lenses of these drones.</p>
